  **`SUM`**, **`AVERAGE`**, **`UNIQUE`**, **`COUNTIF`**

  ```Excel

  |Customer Name| Revenue | Subscription Type |
  | Liam        |  3000   | Basic             |
  | John        |  2500   | Basic             |

  | John        |  2500   | Basic             |

   =SUM(B2:B6)
   =AVERAGE(B2:B6)
   =UNIQUE(A2:A6)
   =COUNTIF(C:C,"Basic")

  ```

 - Data Summarization: create summaries using **`Pivot Tables`** making it easier to identify patterns or issues.
